# About Me
I am a detail-oriented, adaptable, ambitious student seeking employment in data science, UI/UX design, and product management. I am skilled in designing solutions, building applications, and supporting others in developing technical skills. 

I recently worked as a UI/UX engineer, redesigning a frontend using modern UX principles and A/B testing. I have full-stack development experience constructing CRM software. As a teaching assistant at Northeastern, I graded assignments and provided guidance to 30 students as they navigated Python programming concepts.

I am motivated to continue learning, honing my skills, and solving problems with technology. My strengths include quick mastery of new programming tools, collaboration across teams, and ability to evaluate and focus on end-user needs when designing interfaces.

As I explore professional roles, I am seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills while connecting with end-users to develop intuitive, user-friendly applications. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my background and skillset.
