# About Me
I am a detail-oriented, adaptable, ambitious student seeking employment in data science, UI/UX design, and product management. I am skilled in designing solutions, building applications, and supporting others in developing technical skills. 

I recently worked as a UI/UX engineer, redesigning a frontend using modern UX principles and A/B testing. I have full-stack development experience constructing CRM software. As a teaching assistant at Northeastern, I graded assignments and provided guidance to 30 students as they navigated Python programming concepts.

I am motivated to continue learning, honing my skills, and solving problems with technology. My strengths include quick mastery of new programming tools, collaboration across teams, and ability to evaluate and focus on end-user needs when designing interfaces.

As I explore professional roles, I am seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills while connecting with end-users to develop intuitive, user-friendly applications. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my background and skillset.

# Projects

## Recipe Recommendation System (Group Project)
Constructed a website using HTML, CSS, and Neo4j to provide users with recipe suggestions based on their preference data. Utilized Flask in Python to gather user input data and provide dynamic recipe recommendations.

## UI/UX Design (Co-Op) - ISS Group - [See UI Here](https://github.com/julianwsavini/Co-Op-Project)
Designed and developed new Purchase Order frontend using modern UX principles. Built intuitive interface with HTML, Material Design Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Applied A/B testing to optimize app features and usability.

## Data Visualization (Group Project) - [BlueBike Traffic/Accident Analysis](https://github.com/julianwsavini/BlueBikes_Visualization_Final_Project)
We were tasked with creating data visualizations that can be of use to a designated stakeholder. We designed an interactive graph for the team at BlueBikes responsible for deploying stations. Our visualizations used bike accident data paired with station data, to hopefully ensure safety of the BlueBikes customers. The first graph is a heat map of bike accidents, with points of where stations are located. If you hover over the points, you can see the in and out flow of each station. If you switch modes, you can drag your mouse over the left graph to see where accidents are occuring (street versus intersection). This data can be of use to our stakeholders, who can hopefully use this to carefully place stations away from hazardous areas.

## What I contributed:
Once my group had created the heatmap, I was responsible for making the bar and pie chart, and linking these charts to the heat map such that they were interactive. This involved creating tooltips, brushing and linking, and hovering over elements to regenerate new graphs. I also was a large part of the design process, where I was accessing who our stakeholders are, and what visualizations could be used to help in their decision making of where BlueBike stations should be to ensure safety.

### Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (d3 library)

## Machine Learning - [News Classifier](https://github.com/julianwsavini/news_classification)
Constructed ML model to identify potentially false news articles with 92% accuracy. Utilized Python and scikit-learn to train and test classification algorithm.

# Future Projects
