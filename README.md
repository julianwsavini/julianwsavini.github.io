# About Me
I am an adaptable, thorough, and ambitious student exploring careers in data science, UI/UX design, and product management. As my work experiences show, I enjoy opportunities to design solutions, build applications, and support others in developing their technical skills. 

I recently worked as a UI/UX engineer, redesigning a frontend using modern UX principles and A/B testing. I also gained full-stack development experience constructing CRM software. As a teaching assistant at Northeastern, I helped guide 30 students through Python programming concepts and graded over 300 assignments.

I am motivated to continue learning and solving problems with technology. My strengths include quickly mastering new programming tools, collaborating across teams, and focusing on end-user needs when designing interfaces. Outside academics and work, I enjoy activities like drumming, snowboarding, and playing tennis. 

As I explore professional roles, I look for opportunities to apply my technical skills while connecting with end-users to develop intuitive, user-friendly applications. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my background.
