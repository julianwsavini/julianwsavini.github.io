# About Me
I am a detail-oriented, adaptable, ambitious student seeking employment in data science, UI/UX design, and product management. I am skilled in designing solutions, building applications, and supporting others in developing technical skills. 

I recently worked as a UI/UX engineer, redesigning a frontend using modern UX principles and A/B testing. I have full-stack development experience constructing CRM software. As a teaching assistant at Northeastern, I graded assignments and provided guidance to 30 students as they navigated Python programming concepts.

I am motivated to continue learning, honing my skills, and solving problems with technology. My strengths include quick mastery of new programming tools, collaboration across teams, and ability to evaluate and focus on end-user needs when designing interfaces.

As I explore professional roles, I am seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills while connecting with end-users to develop intuitive, user-friendly applications. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my background and skillset.

# Projects

## Recipe Recommendation System (Group Project)
For DS4300: Large Scale Information and Retrieval, we were tasked with using one or more NoSQL databases for our project. 

We were particularly intrigued by using a graph network to construct a recommendation system, particularly a recipe recommendation system. Constructed a website using HTML, CSS, and Neo4j to provide users with recipe suggestions based on their preference data. Utilized Flask in Python to gather user input data and provide dynamic recipe recommendations.

## Data Visualization (Group Project) - [BlueBike Traffic/Accident Analysis](https://github.com/julianwsavini/BlueBikes_Visualization_Final_Project)
We were tasked with creating data visualizations that can be of use to a designated stakeholder. We designed an interactive graph for the team at BlueBikes responsible for deploying stations. Our visualizations used bike accident data paired with station data, to hopefully ensure safety of the BlueBikes customers. The first graph is a heat map of bike accidents, with points of where stations are located. If you hover over the points, you can see the in and out flow of each station. If you switch modes, you can drag your mouse over the left graph to see where accidents are occuring (street versus intersection). This data can be of use to our stakeholders, who can hopefully use this to carefully place stations away from hazardous areas.

### What I contributed:
Once my group had created the heatmap, I was responsible for making the bar and pie chart, and linking these charts to the heat map such that they were interactive. This involved creating tooltips, brushing and linking, and hovering over elements to regenerate new graphs. I also was a large part of the design process, where I was accessing who our stakeholders are, and what visualizations could be used to help in their decision making of where BlueBike stations should be to ensure safety.

### Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (d3 library)

### What Skills I Gained:
- Creating interactive visualizations using Javascript's d3 library
- Design Thinking
- Collaboration

## Machine Learning - [News Classifier](https://github.com/julianwsavini/news_classification)
Although it was only my second year programming, I wanted to be ambitious, and use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to determine if a news article contains false information.

This was a group project, and I was responsible for constructing the machine learning models. Since others had not had any experience in Python, we wanted to play to our strengths, so as others were doing research and creating the project proposals, posters, and slides, I was very excited to perform machine learning. I utilized K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian NB, and Random Forest models to train my data, with the best model receiving an accuracy of 89.2% accuracy.

### What skills I gained:
- Natural Language Processing Data Cleaning Methods (Count and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Vectorizers)
- Hyperparameter Testing
- How to utilize all sorts of functions within the sklearn library!

  
## UI/UX Design (Co-Op) - ISS Group - [See UI Here](https://github.com/julianwsavini/Co-Op-Project)
I was tasked to redesign one of ISS Group's products, iPurchase, a new frontend with Material Design Bootstrap. There are loads of features within this UI, such as field labels are dynamic, the tabs transform into an accordion when the screen size is small, and the tables change layout when the screen size is small as well. It was fantastic to be deeply involved in creating their new UI, and I appreciated how we were never content with our current product. We knew we could always make our system better, so iPurchase went under many, many design iterations. It was a fantastic first co-op experience, and I'm excited to see what I'll be doing next!

Until May, I am working part-time, conducting UX research with our clientele, hoping to gain more insight on what works with our frontend, and what doesn't. I will additionally be rebuilding the frontend with ReactJS.

Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS (MDBootstrap)
- Javascript

# Future Projects

## Song chord prediction with Markov chains (Python)
For my Artificial Intelligence project, my group and I want to use Hidden Markov Models to predict the next chord of a song, given the previous chord progression. We intend to parse through song data and extract note pitch, velocity, and duration from the data to train the model (using Python).

I am excited to also use my music minor and music theory skills to build this project!

## Recipe box web application focusing on user testing and UX
For my Human Computer Interaction project, my group and I are creating a digital recipe box using Figma (as of now), where users can add and edit recipes. We are using modern UI/UX principles, user personas, user research, and prototyping (using Figma) to create the best user interface we can.
